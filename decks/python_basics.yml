questions:
  - id: py1
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "What keyword defines a function in Python?"
    acceptable_answers: ["def"]
    rubric: |
      Accept only the keyword `def` (case sensitive in practice, but allow lowercase).
    hint: "It appears at the start of a function header, followed by the function name and parameters."

  - id: py2
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "What built-in function returns the length of a list?"
    acceptable_answers: ["len", "len()"]
    rubric: |
      Accept `len` or `len()` as the function name.
    hint: "It's three letters and works for many sequences, not just lists."

  - id: py3
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "Which data type is immutable: list or tuple?"
    acceptable_answers: ["tuple"]
    rubric: |
      Correct answer is `tuple`. Lists are mutable.
    hint: "It's the one defined with parentheses."

  - id: py4
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "How do you start a comment in Python?"
    acceptable_answers: ["#", "hash", "pound sign"]
    rubric: |
      Accept `#` or a clear description like 'hash' or 'pound sign'.
    hint: "It's a single character placed before inline notes."

  - id: py5
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "What keyword is used to handle exceptions (the block that catches them)?"
    acceptable_answers: ["except"]
    rubric: |
      The catching block keyword is `except`. (Do not accept try/finally/raise as the catcher.)
    hint: "It pairs with 'try' and sometimes with 'finally'."

  - id: py6
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "What is the Pythonic one-line way to create a list of squares from 0 to 4?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "[x**2 for x in range(5)]"
    rubric: |
      Accept a correct list comprehension form that yields [0,1,4,9,16]. Minor spacing differences are fine.
    hint: "Think list comprehension using range(5)."

  - id: py7
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "Given d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, what expression returns 2 without raising if key missing?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "d.get('b')"
      - "d.get(\"b\")"
    rubric: |
      Accept d.get('b') (or with double quotes). Do not accept d['b'] because it can raise if missing.
    hint: "Use the safe dictionary accessor."

  - id: py8
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "What string literal prefix enables f-strings for interpolation?"
    acceptable_answers: ["f", "f-string", "f''", "f\"\""]
    rubric: |
      Accept 'f' or any clear indication of f-strings (e.g., f'' / f"").
    hint: "It's a single-letter prefix added before the opening quote."

  - id: py9
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "Slice the first three elements of list L. What is the expression?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "L[:3]"
    rubric: |
      Accept exactly L[:3] (allow minor spacing). Do not accept L[0:3] if you want to be strict; if lenient, allow both.
    hint: "Use slicing with an omitted start index."

  - id: py10
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "What keyword creates a lightweight, anonymous function?"
    acceptable_answers: ["lambda"]
    rubric: |
      Accept `lambda`. Make sure the student names the keyword, not an example body.
    hint: "It's often used for short callbacks or key functions."

  - id: py11
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "What module do you import to work with regular expressions?"
    acceptable_answers: ["re"]
    rubric: |
      Accept `re`. Do not accept 'regex' or others.
    hint: "It’s a two-letter standard library module."

  - id: py12
    type: short_answer
    prompt: "In a virtual environment, which command installs packages from requirements.txt?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    rubric: |
      Accept 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Ignore minor spacing differences.
    hint: "It's a pip command with the -r flag."
