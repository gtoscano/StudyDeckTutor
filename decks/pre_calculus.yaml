    prompt: "What is the definition of a function?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "A relation that assigns exactly one output for each input"
      - "Each input has exactly one output"
    rubric: |

    prompt: "What is the domain of the function f(x) = 1/(x - 2)?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "All real numbers except 2"
      - "x ≠ 2"
    rubric: |
      The domain excludes x = 2, because the denominator cannot be zero.

    prompt: "What is the inverse function of f(x) = 2x + 3?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "(x - 3)/2"
      - "f⁻¹(x) = (x - 3)/2"
    rubric: |
      Solve for x in terms of y: y = 2x + 3 → x = (y - 3)/2 → f⁻¹(x) = (x - 3)/2.
    hint: "Swap x and y, then solve for the new y."

    prompt: "Evaluate log₂(8)."
    acceptable_answers:
      - "3"
      - "three"
    rubric: |
      Since 2³ = 8, log₂(8) = 3.
    hint: "Ask: 2 to what power gives 8?"

    prompt: "Convert 60 degrees to radians."
    acceptable_answers:
      - "π/3"
      - "pi/3"
    rubric: |
      Multiply degrees by π/180: 60×π/180 = π/3.

    prompt: "What is the slope of the line 3x - 2y = 6?"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "3/2"
      - "1.5"
