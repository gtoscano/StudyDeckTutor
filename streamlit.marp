## 📊 Common Use Cases

| Category           | Example Apps                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Visualization | Interactive plots with Matplotlib, Plotly, or Altair |
| Machine Learning   | Model demos and parameter sliders                    |
| Education          | Learning tools and simulations                       |
| Text & NLP         | Chatbots, summarizers, language analyzers            |
| Optimization       | Algorithm dashboards and decision support tools      |

---

## ⚙️ Your First Streamlit App

Create a file named `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello Streamlit! 👋")
st.write("This is your first interactive web app in pure Python.")

name = st.text_input("What's your name?")
if name:
    st.success(f"Welcome, {name}!")
```

Then run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

✅ Your app opens automatically in the browser at `http://localhost:8501`

---

## 🧩 Adding Widgets

Streamlit provides intuitive UI widgets:

```python
st.slider("Select a number", 0, 100, 50)
st.checkbox("Enable feature")
st.radio("Choose an option", ["A", "B", "C"])
st.selectbox("Pick a fruit", ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"])
st.button("Click me!")
```

Each widget returns its current **value**, making it easy to connect with your logic.

---

## 🖼️ Displaying Data

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "x": range(1, 6),
    "y": [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
})

st.table(df)
st.line_chart(df, x="x", y="y")
```

🎯 Streamlit automatically detects Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib objects and displays them beautifully.

---

## ⚡ Reactive Model

Streamlit automatically reruns your script from top to bottom whenever input changes.

🧠 Think of your script as a **reactive function** — widgets are *stateful* and persistent between runs.

---

## 🗂️ Layout and Structure

Use containers, columns, and expanders:

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.write("Left column")
with col2:
    st.write("Right column")

with st.expander("See details"):
    st.write("Extra information here")
```

---

## 🌈 Advanced Features

* File uploaders (`st.file_uploader`)
* Caching for expensive computations (`@st.cache_data`)
* Session state for multi-step workflows
* Theming and customization with `.streamlit/config.toml`
* Integration with LLMs, APIs, or databases

---

## 🧠 Example: Mini Quiz App

```python
import streamlit as st

question = "Who developed Streamlit?"
answer = "Streamlit Inc"

st.write("### 🧩 Mini Quiz")
user_answer = st.text_input(question)

if user_answer:
    if user_answer.lower().startswith("streamlit"):
        st.success("Correct! 🎉")
    else:
        st.error("Not quite — try again.")
```

---

## ☁️ Sharing Your App

You can deploy easily on:

* [streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
* [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
* Your own server (e.g., Docker, Nginx, or Gunicorn)
